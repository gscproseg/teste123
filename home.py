# What is Roboflow?
### **Roboflow** makes managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning datasets for computer vision seamless.

### This project utilizes the official [Roboflow python package](https://docs.roboflow.com/python) that interfaces with the [Roboflow API](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference/hosted-api),
### and the new [roboflow-computer-vision-utilities](https://github.com/roboflow-ai/roboflow-computer-vision-utilities/) repo.
### This sample app can be a great first step to help you derive actionable insights from your deployed computer vision models.
